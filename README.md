#FUTURE_CS_03 - Secure File Sharing System 🔐

This is my submission for **Cyber Security Task 3** with Future Interns.  
It is a secure file upload & download portal built with Flask and AES/Fernet encryption.

🚀 Features
- Secure file upload with automatic encryption
- Files stored safely as `<filename>.enc`
- Secure file download with decryption on the fly
- Persistent secret key for reliable encryption/decryption
- User-friendly web interface built with Flask templates

🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask
- PyCryptodome (AES) / Cryptography (Fernet)
- Werkzeug (secure_filename)
- HTML/CSS

🎯 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I was able to:
-Gain practical experience in implementing symmetric encryption web application.
-Understand how to combine web development and cybersecurity practices to build secure systems.
-Apply secure coding standards, including input validation and safe file handling with secure_filename.
-Manage sensitive files effectively using .gitignore, ensuring that keys and uploaded files remain private.
